Sagittarius, in astronomy, zodiacal constellation in the southern sky lying between Capricornus and Scorpius, at about 19 hours right ascension and 25° south declination. The centre of the Milky Way Galaxy lies in the radio source Sagittarius A*. Near the western border of Sagittarius is the winter solstice, the southernmost point reached by the Sun in its apparent annual journey among the stars. This constellation also contains the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas. The brightest star is Kaus Australis (from the Arabic for “bow” and the Latin for “southern,” respectively; it is also called Epsilon Sagittarii), with a magnitude of 1.9. Many of the stars are arranged in the prominent asterism called the Teapot.
