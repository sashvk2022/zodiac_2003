Cancer, in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the northern sky between Leo and Gemini, at about 8 hours 25 minutes right ascension and 20° north declination. It contains the well-known star cluster called Praesepe, or the Beehive. Its brighest star, Al Tarf (Arabic for “the end” [of one of the crab’s legs]), also called Beta Cancri, is quite dim, with a magnitude of 3.6. Cancer (crab), watercolor and ink, from a manuscript created in Ulm or Augsburg, Germany, c. 1464; in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. In astrology, Cancer is the fourth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about June 22 to about July 22. Its representation as a crab (or lobster or crayfish) is related to the crab in Greek mythology that pinched Heracles while he was fighting the Lernaean hydra. Crushed by Heracles, the crab was rewarded by Heracles’ enemy, Hera, by being placed in the heavens.
